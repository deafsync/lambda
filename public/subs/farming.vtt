00:00.000 --> 00:22.480
It took hundreds of thousands of years for the human population to reach 1 billion.

00:22.480 --> 00:27.320
And in less than 200 years, that has increased to nearly 7.5 billion people.

00:27.320 --> 00:31.640
Many scientists calculate the sustainable population to be about 2 billion people, which

00:31.640 --> 00:35.440
means we need to manage our resources and food production very carefully to cater to

00:35.440 --> 00:37.520
the extra 5.5 billion people.

00:37.520 --> 00:41.920
As populations have grown, farming practices have become more intensified to maximise crop

00:41.920 --> 00:46.320
yields and ensure that we can feed our ever-growing population.

00:46.320 --> 00:51.080
Fertilisers and pesticides are used on crops and animals may be kept inside in more densely

00:51.080 --> 00:55.760
packed sheds to maximise milk yields or egg production or speed up the time needed for

00:55.760 --> 00:59.280
the animal to be ready to be sent to the market for meat.

00:59.280 --> 01:04.160
To learn more about conventional farming, watch our video on modern agriculture.

01:04.160 --> 01:07.960
In this video, we are going to look at an alternative to conventional farming, organic

01:07.960 --> 01:08.960
farming.

01:08.960 --> 01:13.460
We are going to see what it is in theory and the pros and cons of this method in relation

01:13.460 --> 01:16.600
to other modern agriculture methods.

01:16.600 --> 01:21.520
Organic farming currently accounts for about 1% of agricultural land worldwide.

01:21.520 --> 01:26.480
It focuses on sustainability and is thought to have less detrimental effects on the environment

01:26.480 --> 01:28.720
than conventional farming.

01:28.720 --> 01:32.520
This has led to it being proposed as an alternative to conventional agriculture for helping to

01:32.520 --> 01:36.400
overcome the climate change crisis we are currently experiencing.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.800
But the debate continues as it is not a perfect solution.

01:39.800 --> 01:44.840
In theory, organic farming should not use chemical fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides

01:44.840 --> 01:47.120
or feed additives for livestock.

01:47.120 --> 01:51.040
It requires the farmer to use more natural alternatives.

01:51.040 --> 01:55.200
This results in lower yields, but the farmer can sell their product at a higher price because

01:55.200 --> 01:58.440
consumers believe the product is of a higher quality.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.880
Instead of fertilisers, manure is used.

02:00.880 --> 02:03.920
This recycles waste and improves the soil structure.

02:03.920 --> 02:08.360
However, it is smelly and more difficult to apply than chemical fertilisers, and also

02:08.360 --> 02:12.080
means the farmer has less control over the mineral content they are putting into their

02:12.080 --> 02:13.520
soil.

02:13.520 --> 02:17.960
Crop rotation is used to reduce diseases building up in the soils and to strengthen the soil

02:17.960 --> 02:19.360
composition.

02:19.360 --> 02:24.200
Farm crops such as the legume family, so peas and beans, fix nitrogen from the air and increase

02:24.200 --> 02:26.000
the nitrates in the soil.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.560
This makes the soil much more fertile, and so farmers rotate legumes with their other

02:30.560 --> 02:31.560
crops.

02:31.560 --> 02:36.480
Growing multiple crops is however less efficient and produces lower yields than specializing

02:36.480 --> 02:38.480
in one or fewer crops.

02:38.480 --> 02:42.240
Instead of using herbicides, weeding is the preferred organic farming technique.

02:42.240 --> 02:46.160
This is of course much more environmentally friendly because it is chemical free, but

02:46.160 --> 02:47.920
it is very labor intensive.

02:47.920 --> 02:51.600
Although this does mean more jobs available, which is a great thing.

02:51.600 --> 02:55.160
Organic farming is thought to maintain the biodiversity better than conventional farming

02:55.160 --> 02:57.120
because fewer chemicals are used.

02:57.120 --> 03:01.640
There are more bumblebees and insects in the area because pesticides haven't been used.

03:01.640 --> 03:05.760
Weeds and non-crop plants can grow as herbicides aren't used.

03:05.760 --> 03:10.160
Biodiversity benefits the food chain across all levels, from the plants up to the foxes.

03:10.160 --> 03:15.440
These are the theories of organic farming, and is how we farmed for 100,000 years before

03:15.440 --> 03:17.120
the Industrial Revolution.

03:17.120 --> 03:21.360
Farmers generally thought that organic farming is much better for biodiversity, and also

03:21.360 --> 03:26.120
produces a healthier product because less chemicals are used on it.

03:26.120 --> 03:30.240
In the second video on organic farming, we will look at some of the problems of organic

03:30.240 --> 03:33.760
farming, and the reality of what it means to be an organic farm.
